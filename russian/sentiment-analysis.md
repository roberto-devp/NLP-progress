## RuSentRel

The [RuSentRel](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel) dataset
consisted of analytical articles from Internet-portal inosmi.ru. These are translated into Russian texts in the domain of international politics obtained from foreign authoritative sources.
The collected articles contain both the author's opinion on the subject matter of the article and a large number of references mentioned between the participants of the described situations. 
The dataset contains 73 large analytical texts, labeled with about 2000 relations.
 
**Sentiment Attitude Extraction task:** Given a subset of documents, in which every document includes: (1) text, (2) a list of mentioned named entities. 
For each document it is required to complete a list of labeled entity pairs [(s<sub>1</sub>->o<sub>1</sub>, l<sub>1</sub>), ... (s<sub>n</sub>->o<sub>n</sub>, l<sub>n</sub>)], 
for which text conveys the presence of the sentiment relation expressed by the subject towards the object (s<sub>i</sub>->o<sub>i</sub>) with sentiment l<sub>i</sub> âˆˆ [neg, pos] (see the example below).
