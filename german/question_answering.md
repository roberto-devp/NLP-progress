### GermanQuAD

[GermanQuAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12741) contains ~14,000 German QA pairs released by deepset in the same format as the original SQuAD dataset. In the same paper, a second dataset called GermanDPR was released, which can be used for training dense passage retrieval models. For each question, it provides a set of relevant and irrelevant documents.
More details are available on the [GermanQuAD website](https://www.deepset.ai/germanquad).
